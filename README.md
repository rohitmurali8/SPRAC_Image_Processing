# SPRAC_Image_Processing

This was the code developed for the SPRAC committee which is a Robotics group in my undergrad college.

This code uses the opencv library and its functions to detect circular rings in an arena, which were the required target 
for our autonomous robot. This code was tried to be implemented on Raspberry Pi which would be used to bring the robot in
its required position. This proved to be quite computationally expensive because of which it could be used with the Raspberry Pi.

Please feel free to try code on your laptops and for any suggestions you can contact me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohitmurali8/
